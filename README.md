✨ The PhilosophyNo templates. No shortcuts.This project is a rejection of
cookie-cutter UI. Every interaction, from the rotation of the 3D orbit to the
glass-like texture of the cards, is custom-coded to ensure pixel-perfect
responsiveness and performance."Motion isn't just decoration; it's
communication."By combining GSAP timelines with Lenis smooth scrolling, the user
doesn't just read the content—they flow through it.

<br />

🛠️ Visual EngineeringWe pushed the boundaries of the frontend stack to create
"Motion Magic." 

<br />

🪐 3D Orbit Visualization: A custom-built, rotating data
visualization that serves as the hero centerpiece, built without heavy 3D
libraries, optimized for performance.

<br />

🔄 Interactive Flip Cards: Complex state management met with Framer Motion to
create tactile, physics-based interactions for displaying metrics.
<br />

🎨 Glassmorphism Engine: Heavy use of Tailwind's backdrop-blur and gradient
utilities to create a modern, frosted-glass aesthetic that sits perfectly on
dark mode.

<br />

🌊 Fluid Navigation: Lenis integration removes the "digital bumpiness" of
standard scrolling, replacing it with a weighted, luxurious scroll feel.
